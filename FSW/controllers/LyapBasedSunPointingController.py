        Calculate the dipole moment and reaction wheel torque command for the satellite's control system.
        This method implements a Lyapunov-based sun-pointing control law to determine the necessary control inputs
        for the satellite to achieve and maintain a desired orientation relative to the sun.
        Args:
            est_ctrl_states (np.ndarray): Estimated control states of the satellite, including quaternion, magnetic field,
                          angular velocity, and sun position.
            Idx (dict): Dictionary containing indices for accessing specific elements within the `est_ctrl_states` array.
        Returns:
            np.ndarray: A 3x1 array representing the dipole moment command.
            list: An empty list (reserved for future use or additional outputs).
        Control Logic:
            - The method first calculates the rotation matrix from the estimated quaternion.
            - It then computes the magnetic field, angular velocity, and normalized sun vector in the body frame.
            - The angular momentum `h` and its norm `h_norm` are calculated.
            - The control input `u` is initialized to zero.
            - The method checks if the satellite is spin-stabilized and sun-pointing based on predefined thresholds.
            - If the satellite is not spin-stabilized, the control input `u` is calculated to align the angular momentum
              with the direction of minimum inertia.
            - If the satellite is spin-stabilized but not sun-pointing, the control input `u` is calculated to align the
              angular momentum with the sun vector.
            - The control input `u` is normalized and scaled by `self.ubmtb` if it is non-zero.
        Note:
            - The method assumes that the input `est_ctrl_states` and `Idx` are correctly formatted and contain all
              necessary information.
            - The control law is based on the reference: https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2024/all2024/56/
